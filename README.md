# EDA and  Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
## OVERVIEW
This project uses K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score. The goal is to group customers into distinct clusters that exhibit similar shopping patterns for better targeting and analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer information, typically including:

- Customer ID (optional)
- Age
-  Gender
-  Annual Income (k$)
-  pending Score (1–100)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
  

 ##  🔍Insights from Customer Segmentation
 ### Cluster 1: Low Income, High Spending

- Customers in this cluster have low annual income but high spending scores.
- Possibly younger shoppers or trend-followers.
- May be price-sensitive but value-driven.
- Good candidates for discount campaigns or loyalty programs.

###  Cluster 2: High Income, Low Spending
  - Customers with high annual income but low spending scores.
  - Possibly cautious or less engaged shoppers.
  - May require personalized engagement or premium services to boost activity.
  
### Cluster 3: Average Income, Average Spending

  - Balanced customers who show moderate income and spending.
  - Represent a stable base of regular customers.
  - Best suited for up-selling or bundling offers.

### Cluster 4: High Income, High Spending
  - Ideal customers: high income and high spending behavior.
  - Likely to respond well to premium products or exclusive offers.
  - Important to retain through high-quality service and loyalty programs.
    
###  Cluster 5: Low Income, Low Spending
 - Less profitable segment.
 - Customers in this group have low income and low engagement.
 - May not be a priority but could be targeted with basic offers or promotions.

## 📌 General Business Insights
- The high-spending clusters can be prioritized for marketing campaigns.
- Customers with potential but low engagement can be reactivated via targeted promotions.
- Cluster analysis reveals hidden patterns in customer behavior that aren’t visible from raw data.
